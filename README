This software is installed into images for guest VMs that are instantiated by 
Eucalyptus with NEuca patches. Images can be RedHat (or derivatives like Fedora
and Centos) or Debian/Ubuntu.

Typical installation involves mounting an existing VM image as a loopback device and
performing chroot into it to perform the installation.

Prerequisites: python-2.6, python-ipaddr, python-boto and make

To install, simply say 'make install' as root. The software does its best to guess
the Linux distribution that is on the image and installs appropriate startup scripts
to be executed at boot time. To uninstall, say 'make uninstall'. 

After the image boots you can also use the following tools from command line:
 * neuca-user-data - retrieve the entire user-data passed to this instance
 * neuca-user-script - retrieve the custom post-boot script (executed as S99 for the
appropriate runlevel)
 * neuca-distro - tells you the best guess of the distribution you are running.
